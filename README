Grat is a minimal content management dealy.

It runs on Rack and uses MongoDB for wicked flexibility.

Woo.

Use it like so:
1. Install gem (may need to set up gemcutter)
2. Fresh directory
3. config.ru file containing:
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rack'
  require 'grat'

  Grat.database_conf # uses defaults, database=grat_development
  # to override:
  # Grat.database_conf(:host => 'localhost', :database => 'grat_special')

  use Rack::ShowExceptions # <- Up to you.
  run Grat::Application
4. rackup (or passenger, if you know how)
