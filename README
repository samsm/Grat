Grat is a minimal content management dealy.

It runs on Rack and uses MongoDB for wicked flexibility.

Woo.

Use it like so:
1. Install gem (may need to set up gemcutter)
2. Fresh directory
3. config.ru file containing:
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rack'
  require 'grat'

  Grat.database_conf # uses defaults, database=grat_development
  # to override:
  # Grat.database_conf(:host => 'localhost', :database => 'grat_special')

  use Rack::ShowExceptions # <- Up to you.
  run Grat::Application
4. rackup (or passenger, if you know how)

5. http://localhost:9292/__admin/edit/mypage edits a page that will be available at http://localhost:9292/mypage
6. http://localhost:9292/__admin/all for a list of all pages
7. http://localhost:9292/__admin/export to get a json dump of all pages
8. http://localhost:9292/__admin/import to import one of those dumps

9. Protect from writes by strangers with Rack::If
   http://github.com/samsm/Rackif
   
   use Rack::If, :method => /(POST)|(PUT)|(DELETE)/ do
     use Rack::Auth::Basic, "Grat protected" do |username, password|
       'secret' == password
     end
   end
